This is a simple HR project.

## What Does it do?
This app will keep track of all the candidates who sent a curriculum for being hired in the company, storing in a database name, surname, birth date and some other basic informations of the candidate. Later on there will be new features and functionalities implemented.

## How it is made?
For now the code is written in C and the database is a txt file. In future the code will be written in an object-oriented language and the database will be an SQL.
